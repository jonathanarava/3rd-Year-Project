Third year Computer Systems Engineering project.

Engineered a model- sized, surveillance vehicle that streams video remotely and is controlled remotely by an android application. The project also requires for data to be received from a sensor (speed sensor mounted on the vehicle) to be logged into a database ( SQLite).

The project parts consisted of :
Vehicle:
1) Raspberry Pi - controls the motors for the wheels
2) Raspberry Pi - handles the video signal receiver and sender to the application over the Wi-Fi (local
host)
3) Speed Sensor - senses the speed of the vehicle

Android Application
View the video stream and also control the vehicle

Computer
1) SQLite database - stores the data from the sensors and also the instruction sent from the
controller

Personal Accomplishments of the project:
- Implemented a SQLite database to log the vehicle's speed received from the speed sensor mounted on the vehicle
- Helped in developement of an android application that would control the vehicle's movements and also stream the video from the camera mounted on the vehicle.
- Successful interaction between all the hardware and software
